# Spring Boot 3 Integration with Python script

This repository demonstrates how to integrate a Python file into a Spring Boot 3 application ( Web and Standalone Application ) . By combining the capabilities of Spring Boot with Python, you can leverage the strengths of both ecosystems in a single project.


## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhileshtrivedi/springboot-integration-python-file.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
   cd springboot-integration-python-file
```     
3. Build the project using Maven:

```sh
   mvn clean install
```   
4. Run the application:

```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
```


## Usage
